# Umano Project #
A web app that maps out all the properties UMANO property management currently manage or previously managed.The UMANO app integrated the google API package that allows us to use the google map feature into our App. Ths App has three pages: Main page, Admin page, and Login page.

  1. The list of property type checkboxes are at the top-left corner. Five properties types: Single-Family, Condo/Townhome,  
     Multi-Family, Retail, Office and Inactive properties. For example, if you are looking for Single-Family property check the Single-          Family checkbox and click enter, it will show Single-Family property on the map only.
